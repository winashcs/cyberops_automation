# python_cybersecurity_projects
This repository contains cybersecurity projects made using python language. Hence we are using python to automate cybersecurity tasks.

**encryption.py**<br>
This program serves as an introductory example for understanding encryption techniques and basic programming concepts within the realm of cybersecurity. It offers a hands-on approach to explore encryption and decryption processes. Encryption and decryption are vital for safeguarding sensitive information, preventing unauthorized access, ensuring privacy, and maintaining data integrity in digital communications, transactions, and storage systems, enhancing cybersecurity and protecting against threats such as data breaches, identity theft, and espionage. This Python program demonstrates a basic encryption and decryption process using a substitution cipher. It prompts users to input a message to encrypt or decrypt. During encryption, each character in the plaintext is substituted with a corresponding character from a shuffled key while decryption reverses this process.

**keylogger.py**<br>
Keyloggers are used to record your keystroke. In this program we create a text file "record", which will keep the track of the keystroke you type every time you run the program and it will stop tracking when you press the escape button on your keyboard. The purpose of this program is to understand the basic concept of keylogger. We can use this program ethically to keep parental control so as to monitor the child's activity on internet. We need to be aware that in some of the cybercafés this type of program will be already installed in the system and will record every keystroke and append it in the "record" file in a hidden folder within the same system.

**mouse_pointer_malware.py**<br>
In this program we created a malware that can continuously change the cursor position and generate random clicks and also it minimizes any running applications which can interfere with normal computer usage. By removing the for loop and implementing the while loop we can create a continuous change in the mouse position. The main purpose of this malware is used to create annoyance. When this type of annoyance takes place, the hacker can use social engineering techniques and make him reveal sensitive information. The purpose of this program is to understand how a simple python code can be used as malware by converting this file to .exe file and sending through phishing emails or spoofed emails hence by this program we educate the user in understanding these concepts.

**password_generator.py**<br>
In today's world almost everything is digitalized and to secure our digital activities we require strong passwords. In this program we take the input from user asking for the length of the password and accordingly it will generate a password which may contains digits, upper case-lower case letters as well as special characters of the given length. This combination can create the strongest password for the user which will be difficult for the hackers to implement password-cracking process onto this password. The purpose of this program is to understand the importance of  generating strong passwords and avoid common pitfalls like using easily guessable passwords or reusing passwords across multiple accounts. Password generators contribute to building a more security-conscious culture.

**password_validator.py**<br>
A password validator helps to assess the strength of the password entered by user on predefined criteria. In this program we ask the user to input the password. If we find that password is weak we tell the user to make the necessary changes. First we check if the length of the password is greater than eight. Once that condition is satisfied we check if the password has at least one upper, lower, digit and special symbols. If the password passes all the tests then we tell the user that the password validation is successful which means the password is strong enough. The purpose of this program is to educate the user to build strong password so as to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.

**screen_rotating_malware.py**<br>
In this program we created a malware that can rotate the device's screen continuously. The main purpose of this malware is used to create loss of productive time and annoyance. This malware also can be a tactic to distract the user from other malicious activities taking place on the device. Hackers can use this malware along with social engineering by immediately calling the user as tech-support thus making him reveal sensitive information so as to fix this issue. The purpose of this program is to educate the user in understanding the various concepts involved in cybersecurity like social engineering and malware.

**website_blocker.py**<br>
In this program we open the host file in read and write mode. It first reads the file by checking if the given website names are already present or not. If it is not present it will add the website name to its list to block that website. The purpose of a website blocker is to regulate and control access to certain websites or categories of websites on the internet. We can use this program mainly to keep parental control so as to prevent the expose of the child to inappropriate website.

Summarizing, in today's interconnected digital landscape, cybersecurity is paramount. These Python cybersecurity projects offer a comprehensive exploration of essential concepts, equipping users with practical skills to defend against a myriad of threats. By engaging in hands-on exercises ranging from encryption techniques to malware creation, individuals gain invaluable insights into the intricacies of safeguarding sensitive information and mitigating cyber risks. Through the process of experimenting with keyloggers, password generators, and website blockers, users not only enhance their technical proficiency but also develop a deeper understanding of the evolving threat landscape. These projects serve as more than just coding exercises; they are educational tools that empower individuals to navigate the complex realm of cybersecurity confidently. Moreover, these projects foster a culture of security consciousness by emphasizing the importance of strong passwords, secure communications, and proactive defense strategies. By simulating real-world scenarios, such as creating malware or implementing parental controls through website blocking, users are better prepared to recognize and respond to potential threats. Additionally, these projects underscore the role of user education in mitigating cyber risks, highlighting the need for continuous learning and adaptation in the face of evolving threats. Furthermore, these projects promote ethical considerations in cybersecurity practices. While exploring the capabilities of keyloggers and malware, users are encouraged to use their knowledge responsibly and ethically. Understanding the potential impact of their actions on privacy and security reinforces the importance of ethical behavior in cyberspace. In conclusion, these Python cybersecurity projects offer a holistic learning experience that goes beyond mere technical skill development. They empower individuals to become proactive defenders of their digital assets and contribute to a safer online environment. By fostering a culture of security awareness, promoting ethical conduct, and providing practical insights into cybersecurity challenges, these projects play a crucial role in preparing individuals to navigate the complexities of cyberspace confidently.
